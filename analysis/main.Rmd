## Notes

This document illustrates the preprocessing of the dataset visualized in this [article on srf.ch](http://www.srf.ch/news/wahlen/wahlkampf/parteibudgets-linke-sind-transparenter-als-die-buergerlichen).

SRF Data attaches great importance to transparent and reproducible data preprocessing and -analysis. SRF Data believes in the principles of open data but also open and reproducible methods. Third parties should be empowered to build on the work of SRF Data and to generate new analyses and applications. 

### R-Script & processed data

The preprocessing and analysis of the data was conducted in the [R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/). The RMarkdown script used to generate this document and all the resulting data can be downloaded [under this link](http://srfdata.github.io/2015-09-elections-cantonal-budgets/rscript.zip). Through executing `main.Rmd`, the herein described process can be reproduced and this document can be generated. In the course of this, data from the folder `ìnput` will be processed and results will be written to `output`. 

**Attention**: Please set your working directory in the first code chunk!

### GitHub

The code for the herein described process can also be freely downloaded from [https://github.com/srfdata/2015-09-elections-cantonal-budgets](https://github.com/srfdata/2015-09-elections-cantonal-budgets). Criticism in the form of GitHub issues and pull requests is very welcome!

## Data description

### Original data source

The data shown here is the result of an email questionnaire conducted by SRF Data and Radio Télévision Suisse (RTS) in July and August 2015 with over 200 cantonal party sections. See the questions asked [here](http://www.srfcdn.ch/elections15/assets/mails_budgets.pdf). In the case of a misunderstanding, clarification was asked for, when no answer was received, follow-up questions were asked.

The data shown is based exclusively on the cantonal party’s own declaration and has not been verified by other sources. A statement on the accuracy of this data can therefore not be made, neither on the total budget nor on the sources of finance. A question mark for the financial sources can have the following meanings: 1. the cantonal party cannot give any declaration, 2. the cantonal party does not want to make any declaration, 3. the figures could not be calculated. In the canton of Jura, the budget cannot always be separated between the federal and cantonal elections, which both take place on October 18.

* `input/data.csv` - The original survey response data, already double-checked, preprocessed and cleaned by SRF Data. Is copied over 1:1 to the `output` folder.
* `input/parties.csv` - Contains party classifications made by SRF Data with the help of political scientists, used throughout all projects related to elections. Is copied over 1:1 to the `output` folder.

  basic.packages.blank <-  c("stats", "graphics", "grDevices", "utils", "datasets", "methods", "base")
  basic.packages <- paste("package:", basic.packages.blank, sep = "")

  if (length(package.list) > 0)  for (package in package.list) {
    detach(package, character.only = TRUE, unload = TRUE)
    print(paste("package ", package, " detached", sep = ""))
  }
  
  #   # unload namespace
  #   lapply(rev(setdiff(loadedNamespaces(), basic.packages.blank)), function(pkg){
  #     unloadNamespace(pkg)
  #     print(paste("namespace ", package, " unloaded", sep = ""))
  #   })
}

detachAllPackages()

rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) 

# Adapt working directory! 
path_to_wd <- switch(EXPR = system2("whoami", stdout = TRUE),
                     "johndoe" = "~",
                     NULL)
if ( is.null(path_to_wd) )
{
  print("WARNING: No working directory specified for current user")
} else
{
  setwd(path_to_wd)
}
```

### Define packages

```{r define packages}
# von https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/web/packages/checkpoint/vignettes/using-checkpoint-with-knitr.html
cat("library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(jsonlite)", 
file = "manifest.R")
package_date <- "2015-08-01"

```

### Install packages

```{r install packages}
if(!require(checkpoint)) {
  if(!require(devtools)){
    install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
    require(devtools)
  }
  devtools::install_github("checkpoint", username = "RevolutionAnalytics", ref = "v0.3.2", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  require(checkpoint)
}
if(!dir.exists("~/.checkpoint")){
  dir.create("~/.checkpoint")
}
checkpoint(snapshotDate = package_date, project = path_to_wd, verbose = T, scanForPackages = T, use.knitr = F)
rm(package_date)
```

### Load packages

```{r load packages}
source("manifest.R")
unlink("manifest.R")
```

## Read in Data

```{r read in data}
# read in and save in output folder
destination_data <- read.csv("input/data.csv")
parties <- read.csv("input/parties.csv")

# save
write.csv(destination_data, "output/data.csv", row.names = F, quote = T, na = "")
write.csv(parties, "output/parties.csv", row.names = F, quote = T, na = "")
```



## Analysis

### Transparency per party

```{r transparency per party}
# count == 2 p.P.
perparty <- destination_data %>% 
  group_by(party_id) %>% 
  summarize(count_transparent = sum(transparency_level == 2), count_all = sum(transparency_level >= 0), count_percentage = count_transparent/count_all) %>% 
  left_join(parties, by = c("party_id" = "id")) %>% 
  select(abbr_en, count_transparent, count_all, count_percentage) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_transparent), desc(count_percentage)) 
perparty
# perparty %>% 
#   write.csv("output/perparty.csv")
```

### Transparency per canton

```{r transparency per canton}
# count == 2 p.P.
percanton <- destination_data %>% 
  group_by(canton) %>% 
  summarize(count_transparent = sum(transparency_level == 2), count_all = sum(transparency_level >= 0), count_percentage = count_transparent/count_all) %>% 
  select(canton, count_transparent, count_all, count_percentage) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_transparent), desc(count_percentage))
percanton %>% 
  as.data.frame()
# percanton %>% 
#   write.csv("output/percanton.csv")
```


### Total budget / estimation

```{r total budget}
overall_budget <- destination_data %>% filter() %>% summarize(sum_lower = sum(budget_total_lower, na.rm = T), sum_upper = sum(budget_total_upper, na.rm = T))
transparency_rate <- destination_data %>% filter(transparency_level == 2) %>% summarise(count = n()) / nrow(destination_data)
response_rate <- destination_data %>% filter(transparency_level >= 1) %>% summarise(count = n()) / nrow(destination_data)

estimation <- overall_budget / transparency_rate[1,1]
```

Based on our data at hand we can say that parties spend between `r as.integer(overall_budget$sum_lower)` and `r as.integer(overall_budget$sum_upper)` Swiss francs.
Based on our data at hand and a transparency rate of `r paste(as.integer(transparency_rate[1,1] * 100), "%")`, we can estimate that cantonal parties spend between `r as.integer(estimation$sum_lower)` and `r as.integer(estimation$sum_upper)` Swiss francs. *Note*: This is a very conservative estimate, since the parties spending the most (SVP, FDP) are usually the ones that are not transparent. And it is also an uncertain estimate, because it does not consider the inter-cantonal budget- and transparency distribution.
